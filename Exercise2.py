#In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.
a = 8 #adds value to variable a
b = 10 #adds value to variable b
sum = a + b #calculates the sum of a + b and adds the result to sum
print(sum) 
#In the code above, two variables have been declared with another variable to store the sum of the two and then outputed with the result.
