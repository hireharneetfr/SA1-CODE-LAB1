#In this exercise, you'll create a program that stores and prints your name, hometown, and age to the console using a Python dictionary.
name = input("type your first name: ") #asks user for its first name
name2 = input("type in your second name: ") #asks user for its second name
home = input("type your hometown: ") #asks user for its hometown
age = int(input("type your age: ")) #asks user for its age
print()
print(f"Your name is {name} {name2}.") #outputs the users complete name by joining first and second name
print(f"Your hometown is {home}.") #outputs the hometown of the user
print(f"Your age is {age}.") #outputs the age of the user
#In the code above, it asks for the name, home and age from the user and outputs the same.
